Code Samples
==================

The example code in this repository is from VanRuby talk on Object Oriented
Design.

There is the following examples:

 * [`values.rb`](https://github.com/adamcooper/vanruby-meetup-ood/blob/master/examples/values.rb) - Code samples during the OOD section
 * [`service.rb`](https://github.com/adamcooper/vanruby-meetup-ood/blob/master/examples/service.rb) - Sample usage of the original service approach
 * [`service_base.rb`](https://github.com/adamcooper/vanruby-meetup-ood/blob/master/examples/service_base.rb) - A sample of the implementation that was too complicated
 * [`service_current.rb`](https://github.com/adamcooper/vanruby-meetup-ood/blob/master/examples/service_current.rb) - A sample from my current service approach
 * [`active_layer.rb`](https://github.com/adamcooper/vanruby-meetup-ood/blob/master/examples/active_layer.rb) - A sample from my current service approach
 * [`form_object.rb`](https://github.com/adamcooper/vanruby-meetup-ood/blob/master/examples/form_object.rb) - A newer approach to the active layer using form objects
